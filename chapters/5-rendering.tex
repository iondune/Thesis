\section{Nearby Terrain}

Nearby terrain is rendering using a pseudo-voxel representation designed to allow for sloped surfaces while maintaining intuitive live editing capabilities.

\subsection{Voxel algorithm}

Diagonal faces.

Interior face culling.

SSAO.

\section{Far Terrain}

Far terrain is rendered using an implementation of geometry clipmaps with a few modifications.

Geometry shader normal calculation.


\section{Vegetation}

Mesh instances.

Impostors.

\section{Water}

Geometry clipmaps.

Gerstner waves.
