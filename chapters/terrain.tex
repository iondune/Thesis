\chapter{Terrain}

\section{Generation}

\subsection{World Map}

The terrain is generated by first establishing a world map at course resolution, then selecting from a series of different landscape generators based on general elevation.
The world map uses a single distorted brownian layer with a box ramp to force oceans at all borders.
The base elevations are scaled for a theoretical maximum of 1000 feet and minimum of -750ft.
However, the individual landscape generators may produce values above or below these amounts.


\section{Rendering}

\subsection{Nearby Terrain}

Nearby terrain is rendering using a pseudo-voxel representation designed to allow for sloped surfaces while maintaining intuitive live editing capabilities.

\subsection{Far Terrain}

Far terrain is rendered using an implementation of geometry clipmaps with a few modifications.

\subsection{Forestation}
