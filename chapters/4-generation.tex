\section {Terrain}

\subsection{World Map}

The terrain is generated by first establishing a world map at course resolution, then selecting from a series of different landscape generators based on general elevation.
The world map uses a single distorted brownian layer with a box ramp to force oceans at all borders.

The base elevations are scaled for a theoretical maximum of 1000 feet and minimum of -750ft.
However, the individual landscape generators may produce values above or below these amounts.

\subsection{Regions}

Because the values generated for the world map are sparse (one posting every 1024 feet) it inherently lacks high frequency noise.
This makes it useful for generating features such as cliffs at the intersection between different elevations.
