\section{Terrain Generation Using Procedural Models Based on Hydrology}

This is a terrain generation technique, though the authors also touch on their approach to rendering the terrain surface.
One interesting aspect to note is their novel approach to storing the terrain which focuses on a hierarchy of features instead of only considering geometry.
I think this technique could prove a useful inspiration for designing other scalable systems besides terrain.

The main point of this paper is to generate terrain using a physically accurate hydrology model.
The results speak for themselves - using their technique produces visually stunning images.


\section{Terrain Synthesis from Digital Elevation Models}

This paper is mostly interesting because of the quality of the resulting terrains.
Their technique involves sampling real terrain data using a user-controlled shape/template to generate a new terrain.

For some games this process has tremendous potential for allowing some artist control of the surface while still importing tremendous detail that doesn't need to be artistically controlled.
